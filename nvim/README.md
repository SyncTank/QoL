The config uses lsp-config that runs mason to auto install the lsp.

Ethier install the lsps your self and remove the lanuages in the config, or install the required items.

I use scoop for the installation process, but anything works as long as it is detected in your terminal.
Also included my everyday setup in scoop.

Required Items:
lua
lua-language-server
ripgrep

Everyday setup (my list):
neovim
zls
zig
ripgrep
python
nodejs
mingw
mysql
make
lua
lua-language-server
llvm
go
dark
clangd
7zip
